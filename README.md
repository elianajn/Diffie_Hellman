## Diffie-Hellman Discrete Logarithmic Problem
### Mad Dog, Dith Dog, Ella
Encryption Algorithm that allows a secret key (number) to be separately generated by two parties, but the number cannot be generated by anyone other than those two parties. The key to cryptographic algorithms is math that is easy to do in one direction, but difficult to undo (think unmixing paint colors). Makes simple arithmetic operations very hard to undo by creating an illusion of randomness.

Picking the numbers:
* p is a large prime number
* g is a primitive root modulo p
* Primitive Root: every integer k coprime to p is congruent to a power of g mod p. 
* Basically, as integer k increases from 1 to p, gk mod p will hit every number between 1 and p-1.
* No restrictions on a and b.

Computational hardness is the assumption that a problem cannot be solved efficiently where ‘efficient’ is qualified as in polynomial time or less. The security of Diffie Hellman is based on ‘the discrete logarithm problem’ which is the assumption that there is no efficient way to find x in: bx = a
