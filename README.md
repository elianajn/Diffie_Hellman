## Diffie-Hellman Discrete Logarithmic Problem
### Mad Dog, Dith Dog, Ella
Encryption Algorithm that allows a secret key (number) to be separately generated by two parties, but the number cannot be generated by anyone other than those two parties.

Picking the numbers:
*p is a large prime number
*g is a primitive root modulo p
**Primitive Root: every integer k coprime to p is congruent to a power of g mod p. 
**Basically, as integer k increases from 1 to p, gk mod p will hit every number between 1 and p-1.
*No restrictions on a and b.
